☕ Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

Welcome to my first Excel Dashboard Project! As a fresher and aspiring data analyst, I created this dashboard to practice data visualization, improve my Excel skills, and gain real-world experience in analyzing sales data for a coffee shop.

📌 Project Objective
